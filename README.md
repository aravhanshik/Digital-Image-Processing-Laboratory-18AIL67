1. Write a Program to read a digital image. Split and display image into 4 quadrants, up, down, right and left.

2. Write a program to showrotation, scaling, and translation of an image.

3. Read an image, first apply erosion to the image and then subtract the result from the original. Demonstrate the differencein the edge image if you use dilation instead of erosion.

4. Read an image and extract and display low-level features such as edges, textures usingfiltering techniques.

5. Demonstrate enhancing and segmenting low contrast 2D images.
